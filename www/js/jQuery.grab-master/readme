This is a ported library from Jin.js::gestures.

It basically allows you to have unified gesture on both touch and mouse devices to 'grab' onto objects and cast events to that.

It provides the event objects with three pieces of information:
 * position (pageX and pageY)
 * move (how much mouse moved since previous event)
 * offset (how much mouse has moved since start)
 * start

Example:
$('div').grab({
	onstart: function(e){
		this.innerHTML = 'Started at ' + e.position.x + ', ' + e.position.y + '<br />';
	},
	onmove: function(e){
		$(this).css({
			left: (e.move.x < 0 ? '' : '+') + e.move.x + 'px',
			top: (e.move.y < 0 ? '' : '+') + e.move.y + 'px'
		});
	},
	onfinish: function(e){
		this.innerHTML += 'Finished at ' + e.offset.x + ', ' + e.offset.y + '<br />';
		this.innerHTML += e.passdata;
	},
	passdata: 'The stuff got succesfully passed.' // you can name this argument whatever you like, the whole object is passed on.
});
